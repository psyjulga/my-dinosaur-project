# My Dinosaur Project

This is a Udacity's Project on Object-Oriented JavaScript.

## About

We combine our knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to build an application that renders an infographic based on internal (json) and external (user input) data.

### Objectives

We gain more practice in programming and apply Object Orientation for the first time.
