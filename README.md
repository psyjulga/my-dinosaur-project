# Object-oriented JavaScript Project: Dinosaurs

## About

We combine our knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to build an application that renders an infographic based on internal (json) and external (user input) data.

 ```
From cats to dinosaurs, which I also love a lot!
To accomplish this final project of our
object-oriented JavaScript course I had to apply
everything we learned in the lessons as well as to 
extend that knowledge, do my own research,
be creative and refactor again.
A challenging and rewarding task. And on my further
coding journey I soon realized how important it is to
have a solid understanding of object orientation.
Every journey starts with that first step! 👣
